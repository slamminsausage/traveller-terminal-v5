The Butler Chemical Company doesn’t just want a piece of the action, they want it all. I told them I could feed them reports, but now they’re pushing for physical samples. Not sure how I'll figure out how to sneak them samples but they're giving me a month otherwise no payment.",

Overheard him say this is a mutual deal, we provide sophonts you get my employers what they need. Ezrahm might think she’s in control, but she’s just a pawn in a much bigger game.

Elara keeps muttering things in her sleep, talking like she’s carrying on full conversations. Voren? He just watches. The others, they react to the drugs as expected, but these two? It's like they're already broken in ways I don’t understand. Heard someone say something about 'ES1' and that they took the 'other one' to a Lysani Blacksite.",

I’ll be gone before they even realize what’s missing.\n\nAnd if the lab rats go nuts in the process? Not my problem.",
