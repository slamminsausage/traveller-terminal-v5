    "content": "Sayelle's condition continues to deteriorate. Cybernetic enhancements functioning at optimal levels, but psychological stability declining rapidly.\n\nHer obsession with the surviving Vanagandr crew members has intensified. Surveillance logs indicate she's been leaving messages and tracking devices without authorization. This behavior, while disturbing, may prove useful in drawing out remaining crew.\n\nDr. Mercer recommends neural recalibration, but I'm hesitant to remove the edge her instability provides. Will monitor situation and intervene if her effectiveness is compromised.\n\nSecurity access remains temporarily restricted to auction-related facilities only.",
