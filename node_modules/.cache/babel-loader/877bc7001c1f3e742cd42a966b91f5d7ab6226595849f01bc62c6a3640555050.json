The crystalline structure appears to respond to both electrical stimulation and nearby cognitive activity.\n\nTest subjects exposed to the Shard for periods exceeding 30 minutes report sensory experiences that cannot be explained by conventional science. These include:\n- Heightened awareness of surrounding electromagnetic fields\n- Ability to perceive quantum fluctuations normally imperceptible to human senses\n- Recurring visions of a vast, dark space filled with geometric patterns\n\nWARNING: Extended exposure leads to neurological changes that persist after removal from proximity to the Shard. Subjects Trevar, Elara, and Voren all display these persistent effects, though each manifests differently.\n\nThe Shard appears to be a fragment of a larger whole. Theoretical models suggest a complete artifact would be capable of [DATA CORRUPTED]\n\nCRITICAL: Subject Trevar's final report indicates the Shard may be attempting communication. Before his disappearance, he left the following statement:\n\n\"It doesn't just change you. It opens doors in your mind that were never meant to be opened.

Believes we seek the Shard for profit. Unaware of true purpose.\n- Lysani Labs: Provides scientific expertise, but their corporate agenda conflicts with our goals. Monitor closely.\n- Operative Nex: Successfully infiltrated auction security. Will provide internal sabotage when required.\n\nTARGET PRIORITIES:\n1. Eclipse Shard recovery\n2. Elimination of all Vanagandr crew members\n3. Removal of Lysani Labs personnel with direct knowledge\n\nNOTE FROM COMMANDER:\nThe Vanagandr crew presents an anomaly. Standard memory suppression protocols have failed on multiple subjects. Their continued survival is problematic. The reappearance of their ship suggests the crew may have retained more knowledge than anticipated.\n\nRecommended course: Allow auction to proceed. Use chaos as cover for asset extraction.

The crystalline structure appears to respond to both electrical stimulation and nearby cognitive activity.\r\n\r\nTest subjects exposed to the Shard for periods exceeding 30 minutes report sensory experiences that cannot be explained by conventional science. These include:\r\n- Heightened awareness of surrounding electromagnetic fields\r\n- Ability to perceive quantum fluctuations normally imperceptible to human senses\r\n- Recurring visions of a vast, dark space filled with geometric patterns\r\n\r\nWARNING: Extended exposure leads to neurological changes that persist after removal from proximity to the Shard. Subjects Trevar, Elara, and Voren all display these persistent effects, though each manifests differently.\r\n\r\nThe Shard appears to be a fragment of a larger whole. Theoretical models suggest a complete artifact would be capable of [DATA CORRUPTED]\r\n\r\nCRITICAL: Subject Trevar's final report indicates the Shard may be attempting communication. Before his disappearance, he left the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't just change you. It opens doors in your mind that were never meant to be opened. And something is waiting on the other side.\"`,\r\n    audioFile: null,\r\n    showImage: false,\r\n    autoPlayAudio: false,\r\n    ambientType: 'corrupted'\r\n  },\r\n  \"blacktalonops\": {\r\n    title: \"Black Talon Operation Files\",\r\n    content: `BLACK TALON CARTEL\r\nOPERATION: MIDNIGHT HARVEST\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Secure control of the Eclipse Shard and eliminate all witnesses.\r\n\r\nASSET STATUS:\r\n- Rax Vennik (Syndicate): Remains cooperative but unreliable. Believes we seek the Shard for profit. Unaware of true purpose.\r\n- Lysani Labs: Provides scientific expertise, but their corporate agenda conflicts with our goals. Monitor closely.\r\n- Operative Nex: Successfully infiltrated auction security. Will provide internal sabotage when required.\r\n\r\nTARGET PRIORITIES:\r\n1. Eclipse Shard recovery\r\n2. Elimination of all Vanagandr crew members\r\n3. Removal of Lysani Labs personnel with direct knowledge\r\n\r\nNOTE FROM COMMANDER:\r\nThe Vanagandr crew presents an anomaly. Standard memory suppression protocols have failed on multiple subjects. Their continued survival is problematic. The reappearance of their ship suggests the crew may have retained more knowledge than anticipated.\r\n\r\nRecommended course: Allow auction to proceed. Use chaos as cover for asset extraction.

Prefers psychological warfare tactics to destabilize targets before engagement.\r\n\r\nHANDLER NOTES:\r\nSayelle's survival on Neon was unexpected but ultimately beneficial. Her obsession with the Vanagandr crew has intensified following her near-death experience.
